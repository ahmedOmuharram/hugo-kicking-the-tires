### Project 1

This is a project. It's a description of the project. It's a list of technologies used. It's a link to the project.

### Project 2

This is another project. It also has a description, a list of technologies used, and a link to the project.

### Project 3

Surprisingly, this is also a project! Guess I'm good at making stuff up.

Jokes aside, wanna see my actual projects? [Check them out here](https://muharram.dev/#/projects)
